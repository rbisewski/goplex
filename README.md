# goplex - a library of useful math formulae, written in golang 

This repo contains a collection of various mathematical disciplines that
have been written in golang, for convenient use with other golang code.

Currently it contains the following formulae:

* Lorentz factor
* Relativistic Perihelion Shift
* Thermal velocity
* Tsoilkovsky Delta-V
* Schwarzschild radius

Feel free to fork it and use it for other projects if you find it
useful.


# Requirements

The following is needed in order for this to function as intended:

* Linux kernel 4.0+
* golang 1.7+

Older kernels could still give some kind of result, but I *think* most of
the newer versions of golang require newer kernels. Feel free to email me if
this is incorrect.


# Installation

Git clone this repo as you would via your go code path.
